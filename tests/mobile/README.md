# Welcome to our Mobile Development Test!

The purpose of this test is to know a little bit more about how you code, how well you know the platform SDK, general development best practices and software architecture.

## Project Description

As a Mobile Developer you've been tasked with the development of an app for game lovers. This first version (MVP) of the app will be very simple and limited to only showing the list of games by plataform and displaying the details of each game on a separate screen.

## Functional Requirements

You're going to develop 2 screens:

**Games List**: The user will be able to choose the desired platform on the top bar, which will then load the list of games on screen. Each game on the list will show an image and a name;

**Game Details**: When selecting a game on the list, the user will be redirected to the game details screen, where the image, name, genre, available platforms and description for that game will be shown.

![Game List](images/games.png?raw=true "Games List")

![Game Detail](images/game_detail.png?raw=true "Game Detail")

## Technical Requirements

Our fictional product is expected to grow fast, so an adaptive solution that responds well to changes is what we want to achieve.

### API

Use the IGDB API to fetch the data to be used in the app:
https://api.igdb.com/

### Deliverables

Please follow the steps below:

1. Create a repository for the source code on BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab;

2. Create a "screenshots" sub-folder and include one screenshot per screen created;

3. Include a README file with special build instructions, list of third-party libraries (with a short description of why they were chosen), and any other note about the code you think we should know;

4. Once the work is complete, send us the link to the repo (if it's public), or grant read access to one of our users, depending on the platform:
	- BitBucket: thiago-valentim
	- GitHub: valentim
	- GitLab: marcvit

Good luck, and enjoy! ;)
