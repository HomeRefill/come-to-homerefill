## The Holes counter problem 
Leonhard Euler wrote several words on a parchment and now he wants to count how many holes are in all the text.

**In this context, what is a hole?**  
If you imagine that the parchment is the plane and the letter is a curve on the plane, then each letter divides the plane into regions.

For example letters "O", "P", "Q", "R", "A" divide the plane into two regions so we say these letters each have one hole. Similarly, letter "B" has two holes and letters such as "Z", "N", "L", "T" have no holes.

We need to help Sr Leonhard Euler to know the total number of holes in the text.

## Input:
The first line contains:
 - an integer X <= 40 that represents the total of cases

After the first line, each line contains:
- uppercase letters of English alphabet
- non-empty text

The length of the text is less then 100 and there are no any spaces in the input.

## Output:
The number of hole per line of each word.

## Example:
**Input:**  
3  
HOME  
REFILL  
SUSTAINABILITY

**Output:**  
1  
1  
2  

## What are we going to analyze?
At first, the output must be correct.

We are going to analyze other requirements:
 - What best practices were implemented
 - What the simplicity of the code (how easy is to understand)
 - What is the code complexity (it will be calculated)

Feel free to use any language you wish!
