# Come to HomeRefill
### HomeRefill is your online butler for home essentials.

Come to HomeRefill and be part of a technology-loving family where the desire to change the world is in the DNA.

We know that technologies, concepts and paradigms are in constant transformation. Models that have worked well in the past need changes to solve problems of the present and future.

## What do we believe?

We believe that people are the key to change and we welcome those who have some special values:

- Transparency;
- Collaboration;
- Learning;
- Commitment;
- Responsibility.

On the tech side, we believe in the following principles:

- Good software development demands planning, involvement with the business, good practices and learning;
- Code needs to be maintainable. Testing and code reviews are key;
- Development pace tops development speed.

## Thinking about the product.

We believe in the truth. Nature seeks the simplest path and solves problems in the most efficient way.

Building a product follows the same truths, so we believe in Lean development, which can be summarized by seven principles:

- Eliminate waste;
- Amplify learning;
- Decide as late as possible;
- Deliver as fast as possible;
- Empower the team;
- Build integrity in;
- See the whole.
